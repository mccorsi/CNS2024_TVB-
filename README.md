## Abstract
Whole-brain network models have recently emerged as a powerful method for studying brain function and dysfunction at the system level. In this context, we primarily access human brain signals through imaging techniques such as magnetoencephalography, electroencephalography and functional MRI. When combined with advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning tools for parameter inference, these models enable us to describe how the brain operates within the constraints of its underlying structure, such as white-matter connectivity but also other biophysical features such as neuromodulation. During this workshop, we will explore the various aspects of constructing these models and how data can be integrated. In particular, we will describe modeling and model inversion workflows that allow identifying the most likely structural causes for the observed macroscopic biomarkers of cognition, age and disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease and Multiple Sclerosis. In addition, such approaches can be applied to understand mechanisms underlying cognitive processes but also to improve existing systems such as brain-computer interfaces.
